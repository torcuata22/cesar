<h1>Welcome to my Caesar Cipher</h1>
<p>(Add definition and history on Caesar's cipher here, myabe a bit about ancient encryption methods)</p>

<p>This is a digital emulator of a Caesar Cipher. This is a substitution cipher, named after 
Julius Caesar, who, according to historians, used it to protect messages of military significance.
While Caesar's was the first recorded use of this scheme, other substitution ciphers are known to have been used earlier. 
</p>

<p>No one knows how effective the Caesar cipher was at the time; 
there is no record at that time of any techniques for the solution of simple 
substitution ciphers. This type of cipher has become inefficient, since it is suceptible
for frequency analysis.</p>
 
<p>However, this type of cipher was used (disastrously) up to 1915 by the Russian army, who used it as a 
replacement for more complicated ciphers that had been too difficult for the troops to master.
As a result, German and Austrian cryptanalysts managed to decrupt their messages with little effort.
</p>

<p>Nowadays, the Caesar Cipher is used more as a novelty or in toys,  not a method of encryption.
With all that in mind, go ahead, give it a try, and have some fun with it!
